# Natural Language Processing
The project combines some approaches for natural language processing. Word embedding approaches such as w2v were used. Training from scratch and pre-training the model was also compared. Neural networks including convolutional and lstm were used for classification.

**The main goal** was to learn the NLP pipelines, develop an understanding of the topic and build core skills.
