# Natural Language Processing
The project combines some approaches for natural language processing. Word embedding approaches such as w2v were used. Training from scratch and pre-training the model was also compared. Neural networks including convolutional and lstm were used for classification.

[w2v.ipynb](w2v.ipynb) considers the feasibility of training a custom model of word embedding, as well as pre-training the resulting model on new data.

[pretrained_lstm_sentiment_analysis](pretrained_lstm_sentiment_analysis.ipynb) focuses on working with a GloVe â€” pre-trained word embedding model, which is used to compare the performance of three neural networks: simple(classical), convolutional and LSTMs.

**The main goal** was to learn the NLP pipelines, develop an understanding of the topic and build core skills.
